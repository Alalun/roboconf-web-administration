<strong>Description</strong>
<br />

The instance's state is undetermined.<br />
It means Roboconf's Deployment Manager has not received a heartbeat from the associated agent for more than 2 minutes.
This can be explained by a network issue on the Deployment Manager's side, a network on the agent's side, a network issue
with the messaging server, or an error with messaging server itself (make sure it is still running).
